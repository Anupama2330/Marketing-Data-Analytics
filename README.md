# Marketing Data Analytics
There are 2240 rows and 28 columns. the name and datatype of each column; in this dataset, integers make up the majority of values. Before doing EDA, the income column needs to be cleaned up since it contains missing data, values that aren't integers or floats, and an additional space in the column name. In order to increase consistency, the column names could be changed. As I previously indicated, the Income column needed some cleaning, so I took the following actions: Use regex and list comprehension to convert all columns to snake case, Set the values as floats and convert the income values to them. The DataFrame is ready for EDA once the data has been cleaned and organized. For the analysis, I first utilized scatterplots and then regression plots.
